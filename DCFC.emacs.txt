God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of spring time - remembering when you were mine in a still, suburban town...When every Thursday, I'd brave those mountain passes, and you'd skip your early classes, and we'd learn how our bodies worked...

God damn the black night with all its foul temptation, I become what I always hated when I was with you then...

We looked like giants in the back of my gray subcompact, fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside...And together, there, in a shroud of frost, the mountain air...Began to pass from every pane of weathered glass and I held you closer than anyone would ever guess...

Do you remember the JAMC and reading aloud from magazines?  I don't know about you, but I swear on my name they can smell it on me...I've never been too good at keeping secrets...No...

And together there in a shroud of frost and mountain air began to pass through every pane of weathered glass, and I held you closer...
